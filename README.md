# Python for Psychologists

This repo contains an introduction to Open and reproducible scientific programming for
psychologists in Python. It stems from a series of seminars held at the University of Frankfurt, Department of Psychology. 
Materials include:

- Class material: a series of notebooks, each corresponding to one in-class session, 
introducing material and providing exercises

- Homework assignments: Students conducted experiments. The experimental programs themselves 
(in [OpenSesame](http://osdoc.cogsci.nl/) or [Psychopy](http://www.psychopy.org)), the resulting data, and the 
analysis in the  form of Jupyter Notebooks are presented.

## Aim of the course



## How you can use this resource

If you have not yet done so: [Download and install Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos), a scientific Python distribution.
Anaconda comes with many or most of the Python packages a researcher needs. It also comes with the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org),
a great starting point for learning and using Python for conducting research. Most of the resources here are Jupyter Notebooks, which you
can download and run on your own computer.

For example, the folder [ExampleAnalyses](https://github.com/jona-sassenhagen/python_for_psychologists/tree/master/ExampleExperiments)
contains experiments conducted by students as final assignments of a Python for Psychologists class.
The Notebooks (*.ipynb files) containing the analyses -- for an example, check out [this 
one](https://github.com/jona-sassenhagen/python_for_psychologists/blob/master/ExampleExperiments/selfpriorisation/selfpriorisation_analysis.ipynb) -- of the results 
are complete, and fully reproducible. To reproduce one, download the notebook and the corresponding data files, store them in the correct file structure,
for example, by [downloading this entire repository](https://github.com/jona-sassenhagen/python_for_psychologists/archive/master.zip),
and open and run them in a Jupyter Notebook.
